## Nature of Phenomena
- Observe
- Describe
  - words
  - Numbers(Unit of measurement)
- Make sense of it
  - Arguments
  - Math theory
- Predict
  - Scientist's role
  - explain things
- Control
  - Engineer's role
  - make things better

### Makes Sense?
- When does a math theory **make sense**?
  - self consistent(모순이 없는)
  - 수학을 배운 다는 것: rules of the game을 배운다는 것.
- 언제 쓸모 있어지냐?
  - when it describes phenomena in the real world
- Math **model**

### Can we find causality of phenomena in the math theory?
- No, Math model is so simple that it cannot capture all the complexity of the real world.

### Two schools of thought
1. Causality in math theory(somehow)
2. Causality never in math theory(near perfect correspondence) <- Beelee's thought
3. Both are useful
   1. Parallel Perspecitve
   2. Classical perspecitve can be derived from quantum perspective

## Nature of Phenomena

-   Observe
-   Describe
    -   words
    -   Numbers(Unit of measurement)
-   Make sense of it
    -   Arguments
    -   Math theory
-   Predict
    -   Scientist's role
    -   explain things
-   Control
    -   Engineer's role
    -   make things better

### Makes Sense?

-   When does a math theory **make sense**?
    -   self consistent(모순이 없는)
    -   수학을 배운 다는 것: rules of the game을 배운다는 것.
-   언제 쓸모 있어지냐?
    -   when it describes phenomena in the real world
-   Math **model**

### Can we find causality of phenomena in the math theory?

-   No, Math model is so simple that it cannot capture all the complexity of the real world.

### Two schools of thought

1. Causality in math theory(somehow)
2. Causality never in math theory(near perfect correspondence) <- Beelee's thought
3. Both are useful
    1. Parallel Perspecitve
    2. Classical perspecitve can be derived from quantum perspective

### 증명

-   무언가가 존재하는 것을 증명하는 것은 쉽다.
-   무언가가 존재하지 않다는 것을 증명하는 것은 어렵다.
-   Observation -> Theory(Postulate(가정), Speculations(추측)) -> Predict results

### Summary

-   A theoretical exercise is only as valid as our ability to demonstrate and observe
-   The Math model predicts results but it cannot explain why.

### Thought exercise

-   Does the electron exist?
    -   is it just a model?
    -   can be observed 'directly'?
        -   no, we cannot observe the object directly.
        -   we can only deduce(추론) from results.
    -   can be observed via ~~experiment~~? apparatus(기구).

### With different observation

-   Different set of theretical formalism
-   Different set of accompanying math model
-   perhaps we can formulate 'Laws'


## Nature of Light
- There is two main schools of thought(switching back and forth over centuries)
    1. Wave nature of light
       1. Robert Hooke(1635-1703)
       2. Christiaan Huygens(1629-1695)
       3. Leonhard Euler(1707-1783)
        - math is based on classical wave mechanics
        - Diffraction(회절), Interference(간섭)
    2. Particle nature of light
       1. Isaac Newton(1642-1727)
       2. Pierre-Simon Laplace(1749-1827)
       3. Simeon Denis Poisson(1781-1840)
        - math is based on Lagrangian mechanics
        - Planck's postulate(양자화)
- 흥미로운 점: 두 이론이 모두 수학적으로 완벽하게 성립하고, 실험적으로도 모두 맞다.

## 실험
1. Wave
   - source -> disc -> screen
   - diffraction, interference
2. Particle
  - Max Planck tried to maximise the output in visible spectrum of light bulb
  - revisit Rayleigh-Jeans law
     - Shorter the length, higher the intensity

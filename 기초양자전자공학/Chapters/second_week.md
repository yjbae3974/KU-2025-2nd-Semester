## Recall: Nature of light

-   can we perceive phenomena directly? No.
-   How can we Perceive phenomena?

    -   Deduce from results <- **observations** <- experiments.

-   Can phenomena be perceived differently?
    -   Yes, depending on the observer's frame of reference.
    -   **Different experiment setup**s can lead to different observations.

### Two aspects of light

1. Wave nature of light
2. Particle nature of light

-   it depends on the experiment setup.
-   Light behaves as a wave in some experiments, and as a particle in others.

### Experiment that shows light behaves as a wave

-   source, disc, screen
-   light from source passes through disc with two slits, and hits the screen.
-   we observe an interference pattern(**bright spot**) on the screen.

- Double-slit experiment
  - light from source passes through disc with two slits, and hits the screen.
  - we observe an interference pattern(**bright spot**) on the screen.
-   explanation: light from the two slits interfere constructively at bright spots.
-   conclusion: light behaves as a wave.
-   But, what happens if we shoot one photon at a time?
    -   we still observe an interference pattern.
    -   conclusion: even a single photon behaves as a wave.
    -   bizzarre, isn't it?

### Experiment that shows light behaves as a particle

-   circuit with a vaccuum tube(광전효과 실험)
-   electrodes(cathode, anode) in a vaccuum tube in complete darkness.
-   How does the electron gets the energy to jump from cathode to anode?
    -   perhaps light provides the energy.
-   $E = h\nu > \phi$ (work function)
    -   $h$: Planck's constant
    -   $\nu$: frequency of light

### Probability of a photon landing in a location

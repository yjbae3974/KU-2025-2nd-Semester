## Recall: Nature of light

-   can we perceive phenomena directly? No.
-   How can we Perceive phenomena?

    -   Deduce from results <- **observations** <- experiments.

-   Can phenomena be perceived differently?
    -   Yes, depending on the observer's frame of reference.
    -   **Different experiment setup**s can lead to different observations.

### Two aspects of light

1. Wave nature of light
2. Particle nature of light

-   it depends on the experiment setup.
-   Light behaves as a wave in some experiments, and as a particle in others.

### Experiment that shows light behaves as a wave

-   source, disc, screen
-   light from source passes through disc with two slits, and hits the screen.
-   we observe an interference pattern(**bright spot**) on the screen.

- Double-slit experiment
  - light from source passes through disc with two slits, and hits the screen.
  - we observe an interference pattern(**bright spot**) on the screen.
-   explanation: light from the two slits interfere constructively at bright spots.
-   conclusion: light behaves as a wave.
-   But, what happens if we shoot one photon at a time?
    -   we still observe an interference pattern.
    -   conclusion: even a single photon behaves as a wave.
    -   bizzarre, isn't it?

### Experiment that shows light behaves as a particle

-   circuit with a vaccuum tube(광전효과 실험)
-   electrodes(cathode, anode) in a vaccuum tube in complete darkness.
-   How does the electron gets the energy to jump from cathode to anode?
    -   perhaps light provides the energy.
-   $E = h\nu > \phi$ (work function)
    -   $h$: Planck's constant
    -   $\nu$: frequency of light

### Probability of a photon landing in a location

## Recall: nature of light
- Light can behave as both a wave and a particle.
- Are those the `true` nature of light?
- Or is it just our perception of light that is limited by our experimental setups?
- Are these complete description?
  - No, we don't know what we don't know.

## Light behaving like a quanta of energy(particle)
-   $E = h\nu > \phi$ (work function) -- energy of a photon
    -   $h$: Planck's constant
    -   $\nu$: frequency of light
-   Experiment: photo electric experiment
-   $E = h\nu$ has to be greater than work function to emit an electron$


## Light behaving like a wave
-   Double-slit experiment
- can we explain the observation with light as a particle? Yes

## Michelson Interferometer
- 실험 구성:
  - Source: 빛을 냄
  - Beam splitter: 빛을 두 경로로 나누어줌
  - Two mirrors: 각 경로의 빛을 반사시켜 다시 빔 스플리터로 보냄. 이때 경로 길이를 조절할 수 있음
  - Screen: 빛을 감지
- 빛이 두 경로로 나뉘어져서 진행
- What happens when the reflected beams are in-phase?
  - Combined beam at maximun intensity (constructive interference)
- What happens when the reflected beams are out-of-phase?
  - Combined beam at minimum intensity (destructive interference)
- What happens with single photon input?
  - Photon behaves like a wave, going through both paths and interfering with itself
  - Detected at the screen as a single point of light
  - So, even a single photon can interfere with itself, showing wave-like behavior

## Interference of a photon
- Photon in a definite translational(입자가 공간에서 직선으로 움직임.) state(나중에 설명)
  - Information about position and momentum
  - Borrowed from classical mechanics
- Beam of light splitted into two components
  - subsequently made to interfere
  - What happens if the beam only consists of one photon? 여전히 간섭무늬가 나타남
- For a Photon to be in a definite translational state
  - It need not to be associated with a single beam of light.
  - It can be associated with two or more beams of light.(광자가 두 경로에 동시에 존재)
- Each translational state can be associated
  - with one of the wave functions
    - in mathmetical sense, of ordinary wave optics or mechanics
  - wave $fn$ can describe a single beam or more beams(splitted from original beam)
- Translationsl states are thus superposable in a similiar way to wave $fn$s
- we can say that the `photon` is partly in each `beam`.

## Photon
- state -> abstract idea
- wave fn -> ath association
- energy -> can be measured by observation

## Energy of a photon
- Either whole proton or none at all
- what happens if we place a detector before the mirror?
